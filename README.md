## Summary

Create a quick RESTful API and React application that consumes. The API should use conventional REST-ful routing, and should handle errors in a logical and clean manner.

## Instructions

1. Download this repository and delete the .git file (please do not fork this)
2. Build a UI/API combination app according to the requirements below
3. Zip up the final results

## Requirements

1. Create endpoints for both entity types (users, cars) that allow the user to:

- [ ] Get all users
- [ ] Get one user by id
- [ ] Create a new user
- [ ] Edit an user
- [ ] Delete an user
- [ ] Get all cars
- [ ] Get one car by id
- [ ] Create a new car
- [ ] Edit an car
- [ ] Delete an car

2. Connect the endpoints to the "database" that is stubbed out in db.ts

- [ ] Keep the main structure the same (an object of arrays)
- [ ] Implement the "queries" in the `db` function

3. Create a React view to list all, see one, edit, create, and delete users
4. Create a React view to list all, see one, edit, create, and delete cars

## Guidelines

1. Spend no more than 2 hours on this
2. Not everything given to you works -- we are also seeing how well you can clean up existing code
3. Use Typescript appropriately to help keep your code clean and secure
4. Don't worry about styling (we are looking for code completion, not visual enhancement)
5. You can use UI libraries if you find it helpful
6. If requirements seem vague, work to the best of your abilities
