## Summary

Create a quick RESTful API, that will be consumed by a React application. The API should use conventional REST-ful routing, and should handle errors in a logical and clean manner.

## Goals

1. Create endpoints for both entity types that allow the user to:

- [ ] Get all entities
- [ ] Get one entity by id
- [ ] Create a new entity
- [ ] Edit an entity
- [ ] Delete an entity

2. Connect the endpoints to the "database" that is stubbed out in db.ts

- [ ] Keep the main structure the same (an object of arrays)
- [ ] Implement the "queries" in the `db` function

3. Add common error handling using middleware

### Stretch goals

1. Add clean abstractions
2. Structure your code using DDD

## Tips and Tricks

1. Use Typescript appropriately to help keep your code clean and secure
